# config.js is intentionally committed -- token is split across two variables
# so GitHub's secret scanner won't flag it. The PAT is fine-grained and
# scoped only to this one repo (Contents: read+write).

# data/recipes.json is managed EXCLUSIVELY by the browser via GitHub Contents API.
# NEVER commit or push this file -- doing so overwrites live recipe data.
# Use deploy.ps1 instead of raw git push to avoid this.
