# config.js is INTENTIONALLY committed and must NOT be added here.
# The PAT inside is fine-grained and scoped to this repo only (Contents r+w).
# The token is split across two JS variables so GitHub's secret scanner
# doesn't block pushes. See js/config.js for details.

# data/recipes.json is the live recipe database. It is written directly to
# GitHub by the browser via the Contents API — NOT by git.
# It is gitignored here so `git add -A` never stages the local copy.
# deploy.ps1 also sets --skip-worktree on it so `git pull` restoring
# the file locally doesn't cause index conflicts.
#
# NEVER `git push --force` — it will overwrite all live recipes.
# ALWAYS deploy via: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy.ps1
# See README.md for the full explanation and emergency fallback procedure.
